\section{Libraries used}
A number of libraries were used as the basis for the project. They are listed below, split by those operating on the client-side of the application (JavaScript, HTML, CSS) and those on the GAE platform (Python).

\subsection{Client-side libraries}
\begin{itemize}
   \item Bootstrap - 3.3.7 - \url{getbootstrap.com} - To ease styling of the app
   \item Fabric.js - 1.6.6 - \url{fabricjs.com} - A wrapper for the HTML5 canvas with serialize functionality
   \item jQuery - 1.12.4 - \url{jquery.com} - For manipulation of the DOM
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Server-side libraries}
The majority of these were GAE libraries required for using the platform's features. These were:
\begin{itemize}
   \item webapp2 - For handling requests as a WSGI application
   \item Setuptools - Used for managing imported python packages
   \item codecs - For reading text files
   \item os - Getting the path of the active project
   \item sys - Basic python module for running on GAE
   \item cgi - Alternative request handler
   \item urllib(2) - For fetching data via secondary requests
   \item random - For generating the random room codes
   \item db - For reading and writing data to the Google DataStore
\end{itemize}
The server-side also made use of:
\begin{itemize}
   \item Wolframalpha - \url{wolframalpha.com} - For querying the WolframAlpha Engine
   \item Jaraco.itertools - \url{github.com/jaraco/jaraco.itertools} - Util package for iteration problems
   \item More-itertools - \url{pypi.python.org/pypi/more-itertools} - Further iteration based utilities
   \item Inflect - \url{pypi.python.org/pypi/inflect} - Used for correct usage of plurals in written parts
   \item Six - \url{pypi.python.org/pypi/six} - Used too soften the differences between different python versions
   \item Xmltodict - \url{github.com/martinblech/xmltodict} - XML parser and encoder
\end{itemize}
